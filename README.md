Brain Tumor MRI Classification using CNN
This project classifies brain tumor MRI scans into four categories using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The categories are:

Healthy Brain
Glioma Tumor
Meningioma Tumor
Pituitary Tumor
Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model that can accurately classify MRI images of brain scans into these four categories. The dataset used contains MRI images for each category and is trained using a CNN architecture. The model performance is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is from the Kaggle competition: Brain Tumor MRI Scans. It contains labeled MRI images of four classes:

Glioma
Healthy
Meningioma
Pituitary
The dataset was downloaded and extracted into different folders for each class.

Key Features
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification.
Data Preprocessing using OpenCV for image resizing and normalization.
Evaluation Metrics including accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.
Visualization of predictions, model performance, and class distributions.
Model Saving for future use.
